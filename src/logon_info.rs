//! `KERB_VALIDATION_INFO`: the structure that says who the client is and which
//! groups it holds ([MS-PAC] §2.5).
//!
//! This is the buffer a Windows service reads to decide what the client may do,
//! and it is the only part of a PAC that cannot be built from anything the KDC
//! knows by itself: the RID, the primary group and the group list belong to the
//! directory. So [`LogonInfo`] is data and [`encode`] is the encoder — nothing here
//! invents an identity.
//!
//! # Why a hand-rolled NDR encoder
//!
//! The structure is [C706] NDR, 32-bit transfer syntax: the fixed part, then the
//! referents its pointers point at, in the order the pointers appear.
//!
//! A PAC buffer holds this structure **from its first octet** — no
//! `TypeSerialization1` common header, no private header, and no leading pointer to
//! the structure. That form is what a marshalled RPC parameter carries, and writing
//! it here is the defect this module was first written with: the scalars then read
//! correctly and every string and array comes back empty, because each pointer is
//! short by the header's length. impacket reported exactly that, and it is the
//! reason the encoder is judged by somebody else's reader.
//!
//! Every pointer is an offset **from the first octet of the buffer**, which is the
//! structure's first octet. A reader follows it; land four octets early and the name
//! it prints belongs to nobody.
//!
//! # What is not written
//!
//! `UserSessionKey`, `LMKey` and the four password timestamps carry nothing a
//! modern realm has: they exist for NTLM fallback and for an account-policy UI.
//! They are written as zero rather than filled with something plausible, because a
//! service that read a fabricated NTLM key would try to authenticate with it.
//!
//! # Reference
//!
//! [MS-PAC] §2.5 for the fields and the buffer form, [C706] §14 for the encoding.
