//! The privilege attribute certificate: what a Windows client reads out of a
//! ticket.
//!
//! Kerberos proves who the client is. A PAC also claims **what that client may
//! do** — the SIDs it holds, when the logon stops being valid — and Windows
//! services take those claims from the ticket instead of asking a directory. An
//! AD world without a PAC is an AD world where every authorisation decision has
//! to be made somewhere else, which is why this module exists at all.
//!
//! # What is here, and what is not yet
//!
//! This module writes the **envelope**: `PAC_INFO_BUFFERS` in the order the
//! specification asks for, each buffer padded to an eight-octet boundary, and the
//! two signatures (`SERVER_CHECKSUM` over the service key, `PRIVSVR_CHECKSUM`
//! over the `krbtgt` key). The envelope is the part a reader uses to find
//! anything at all, and it is the part where every hand-built blob goes wrong:
//! offsets are counted from the start of the PAC, and a buffer that is not padded
//! puts every following offset four octets off.
//!
//! The logon information itself — `KERB_VALIDATION_INFO`, an NDR-encoded
//! structure naming the account's RID and its group SIDs — is **not** built here
//! yet. That is deliberate: it cannot be built from anything this crate knows.
//! The RIDs and the domain SID belong to the directory, and inventing them would
//! produce a PAC that says a client holds SIDs that mean nothing to the server
//! reading it. [`pac`] therefore takes the buffers it is given; a caller that has
//! an identity to state is the one that must state it.
//!
//! # Why the signatures are checked here and not by the reader
//!
//! `PRIVSVR_CHECKSUM` is an HMAC under the `krbtgt` key, and the service that
//! receives the ticket does not hold that key and must never hold it. The KDC
//! signs with it; the service checks `SERVER_CHECKSUM` with its own key and trusts
//! the ticket because it trusts the KDC that issued it. That boundary is the
//! reason the two checksums have different keys at all, and it is what [`seal`]
//! implements.
//!
//! # Reference
//!
//! [MS-PAC] §2.4 (buffers), §2.8.1 (signature), [MS-KILE] §3.4.5.1 (which key
//! signs what), RFC 4757 for the RC4-HMAC checksum's salt and key derivation.
